# Attendance Program

Andrew Raftovich, Fall 2019

## About

This program was created to simplify attendance taking through a Google Sheets document by instead of
inserting scores manually into the Sheet, this program provides a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to allow
users to easily insert/modify scores for students in their section from the full list of students in 
the class.

![example of Google Sheets](/example.png)

The file contains some information before the section scores which will not be affected by the program.
Section scores are in a range from 0 (no points) to 2 (full points).

## Usage

GREEN 	- 2 points
ORANGE	- 1 point
RED 	- 0 points
GREY 	- no entry
