## About

This program was created to simplify attendance taking through a Google Sheets document by instead of
inserting scores manually into the Sheet, this program provides a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to allow
users to easily insert scores for their particular subset of students in their section from the full list
of students in the class.

The file contains some basic information before the section scores which will not be affected by the program.
Section scores are in a range from 0 (no points) to 2 (full points).
